## Algorithms in code
Tasks related to algorithms. 
Mainly written in Julia.
Will by time try to write an example of the most popular and effective algorithms for further use.

## Theory about algorithms
General theory about algorithms.
- Overview of big-O.
- Introduction to algorithms and computer structures.
- Notes about using algorithms effectively in software development.
